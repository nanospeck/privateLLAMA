# PrivateLLAMA (LLAMA 2)

Create a QnA chatbot on your documents without relying on the internet by utilizing the capabilities of local LLMs. Ensure complete privacy and security as none of your data ever leaves your local execution environment. Seamlessly process and inquire about your documents even without an internet connection. Inspired from [SamurAIGPT](https://github.com/SamurAIGPT)

   npm run dev
   ```

2. Go to server folder and run the below commands (feel free to use virtual env)

   ```

3. Open <http://localhost:3000>, click on download model to download the required model initially

4. Upload any document of your choice and click on Ingest data. Ingestion is fast

5. Now run any query on your data. Data querying is slow and thus wait for sometime

6. IMPORTANT: If there are errors in model processing download the model manually from [here](https://huggingface.co/TheBloke/Llama-2-7B-GGML/blob/main/llama-2-7b.ggmlv3.q2_K.bin) and replace the file in folder /models
